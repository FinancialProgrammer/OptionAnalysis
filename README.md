# OptionAnalysis
C++ option analysis <br>

## Data
For option data i have selected to use interactive brokers, <br>
i will try to make the api usage pretty modular and easy to write and plug with your own. <br>
<br>
I will build the client for the program not ibapi, <br>
this will hopefully help not use to many ib specific features. <br>

## Parsing
Parse live and saved data into the same format for analysis. <br>

## Analysis
Analyse option data. <br>

## Visual
Display option data to user (tui/gui/wui (web ui)) <br>
Allow for user interaction with the api and support some local hosted demo services. <br>
